# Capability Attenuation Framework

A formal model for capability-restricted sandboxed execution.

## Definitions

### Source Language

A source language S is defined by:
- **Syntax**: Grammar of valid programs
- **Semantics**: Meaning of programs (operational or denotational)
- **Capabilities C_S**: Set of operations programs may perform

### Target Runtime

A target runtime T is defined by:
- **Execution model**: How programs execute
- **Capabilities C_T**: Set of operations the runtime permits
- **Isolation boundary**: Separation between instances

### Attenuator

An attenuator A: S → T is a transformation (compiler, transpiler, interpreter)
that converts source programs to target programs.

## Formal Properties

### Soundness

An attenuator A is **SOUND** if and only if:

```
∀p ∈ S, ∀c ∈ C_S:
  (c ∉ C_T) ⟹ (A(p) cannot exercise c at runtime)
```

Informally: capabilities not granted by the runtime cannot be exercised,
regardless of what the source program attempts.

**Example**: If the target runtime doesn't provide filesystem access,
a sound attenuator ensures the compiled program cannot access the filesystem,
even if the source program contains filesystem operations.

### Completeness

An attenuator A is **COMPLETE** if and only if:

```
∀p ∈ S:
  (p uses only c ∈ C_S ∩ C_T) ⟹ (⟦A(p)⟧_T = ⟦p⟧_S)
```

Informally: if a program only uses capabilities available in both source
and target, its meaning is preserved.

**Example**: A program that only performs arithmetic should produce the
same results after compilation as it would in the source language.

### Forensic Capture

A runtime T supports **FORENSIC CAPTURE** if and only if:

```
∀ execution e of program p that terminates abnormally:
  T produces state snapshot σ such that:
  - σ contains sufficient information to determine failure cause
  - σ is captured atomically at moment of failure
  - σ is isolated from subsequent executions
```

**Example**: When a WASM trap occurs, the runtime captures the complete
linear memory state before any cleanup, allowing post-mortem analysis.

## The Munition Framework

### Capability Classes

| Capability | Description | Default | Risk |
|------------|-------------|---------|------|
| `compute` | Execute instructions | Granted | N/A |
| `memory_read` | Read linear memory | Granted | Low |
| `memory_write` | Write linear memory | Granted | Low |
| `host_call` | Call host functions | Per-function | Medium |
| `filesystem_read` | Read files | Denied | Medium |
| `filesystem_write` | Write files | Denied | High |
| `network` | Network access | Denied | High |
| `time` | Access system time | Configurable | Low |
| `random` | Access entropy | Configurable | Low |

### Attenuation Strategies

Different source languages require different attenuation approaches:

#### Restrictive Attenuation (PHP, JavaScript)

Source language has implicit universal capabilities.
The attenuator must impose restrictions that the source language doesn't express.

```
C_S = {compute, memory, filesystem, network, time, random, ...}
C_T = {compute, memory}  (default)

Transformation:
- Every filesystem call → host function call (interceptable)
- Every network call → host function call (interceptable)
- Host denies by default, grants explicitly
```

Properties:
- Sound: Yes, by construction (all capability exercise goes through host)
- Complete: Only for pure computation

#### Preserving Attenuation (Pony)

Source language has explicit typed capabilities.
The attenuator maps source capabilities to target capabilities.

```
Pony iso → Rust Box<T> / owned value
Pony val → Rust Arc<T> / shared immutable
Pony ref → Rust (complicated - requires actor model)
Pony box → Rust &T
Pony tag → Rust *const () (identity only)
```

Properties:
- Sound: If mapping is correct
- Complete: For the mappable subset

Challenge: Pony's `ref` (multiple mutable references within actor) doesn't
map to Rust without unsafe or actor runtime.

#### Additive Attenuation (Rust)

Source language already has ownership/safety guarantees.
Compiling to WASM adds additional isolation.

```
C_S = {compute, memory (with ownership), ...}
C_T = {compute, memory, fuel_bound, memory_isolation}

Rust ownership guarantees preserved
WASM adds:
- Linear memory isolation
- Fuel bounding (not in Rust)
- Instance isolation (not in Rust)
```

Properties:
- Sound: Inherited from Rust + WASM
- Complete: Yes (Rust → WASM is well-defined)

## Soundness Proof Sketch

**Theorem**: Munition's execution model is sound with respect to
the declared capability set.

**Proof**:

1. WASM provides a capability-secure execution environment:
   - No ambient authority (all capabilities via imports)
   - Memory isolation (linear memory per instance)
   - Control flow integrity (structured control flow)

2. Munition's import construction is capability-gated:
   - `build_imports/1` only includes functions for granted capabilities
   - Non-granted capabilities result in missing imports
   - Missing imports cause instantiation failure (not runtime failure)

3. Fuel bounding ensures termination:
   - Every instruction consumes fuel
   - Fuel is checked before execution
   - Exhaustion halts execution deterministically

4. Forensic capture is atomic:
   - Capture occurs immediately on failure
   - Memory is read-only after capture point
   - No modification possible between failure and capture

Therefore, the system is sound: no capability outside the granted set
can be exercised, and all executions terminate. □

## Research Directions

### 1. Capability Inference

Given a source program, automatically infer minimum required capabilities:

```
infer: Program → Set<Capability>

Such that:
  ∀p: fire(compile(p), granted=infer(p)) succeeds iff p is valid
```

### 2. Graduated Trust

Dynamic capability expansion based on execution history:

```
trust_level(plugin, history) → Set<Capability>

Where:
  - New plugins get minimal capabilities
  - Successfully behaving plugins gain capabilities
  - Misbehaving plugins lose capabilities
```

### 3. Capability Composition

Safe composition of multiple sandboxed modules:

```
compose: (Module, Capabilities) × (Module, Capabilities) → (Module, Capabilities)

Such that:
  C_composed ⊆ C_1 ∪ C_2
```

### 4. Forensic Analysis Automation

Automated analysis of crash dumps to identify:
- Root cause classification
- Exploitation attempt detection
- Capability escalation attempts
